## Project Description

**DealGenie AI** is designed to streamline content creation for deal listings by automating the generation of engaging, clean, and SEO-friendly deal titles and descriptions. It reads raw, unstructured deal data directly from Google Sheets, then uses GPT-4 to:

- Correct grammar and remove redundancy  
- Craft catchy, clear deal titles  
- Produce rich, emoji-enhanced descriptions in a structured format  
- Generate SEO-friendly titles and meta descriptions for better search engine visibility  

The final formatted content is then written back into the Google Sheet, making it simple to publish directly to your website or platform.
